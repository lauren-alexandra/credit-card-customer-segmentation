## Insights and Recommendations

- There are three segments of customers based on their average credit limit and total credit cards which appear to be the best factors/attributes to determine the segments of a customer of AllLife.
- The Operations team should staff its support services to match the proportion of its customers with a lower number of credit cards as a higher number of calls are made for these customers. 
- AllLife should target customers with a higher average credit limit with credit cards that charge higher fees and services. 
- Customers with poor credit should be targeted with free or low cost fees and services in the customer acquisition phase.
