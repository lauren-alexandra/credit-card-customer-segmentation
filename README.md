# Credit Card Customer Segmentation

Identified different segments in the existing customer based on their spending patterns as well as past interaction with the bank.

## Context

AllLife Bank wants to focus on its credit card customer base in the next financial year. They have been advised by their marketing research team, that the penetration in the market can be improved. Based on this input, the Marketing team proposes to run personalised campaigns to target new customers as well as upsell to existing customers. Another insight from the market research was that the customers perceive the support services of the back poorly. Based on this, the Operations team wants to upgrade the service delivery model, to ensure that customers queries are resolved faster. Head of Marketing and Head of Delivery both decide to reach out to the Data Science team for help.

## Data

Data is of various customers of a bank with their credit limit, the total number of credit cards the customer has, and different channels through which customer has contacted the bank for any queries, different channels include visiting the bank, online and through a call.

## Insights and Recommendations

- There are three segments of customers based on their average credit limit and total credit cards which appear to be the best factors/attributes to determine the segments of a customer of AllLife.
- The Operations team should staff its support services to match the proportion of its customers with a lower number of credit cards as a higher number of calls are made for these customers. 
- AllLife should target customers with a higher average credit limit with credit cards that charge higher fees and services. 
- Customers with poor credit should be targeted with free or low cost fees and services in the customer acquisition phase.
